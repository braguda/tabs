Simple blog application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users need to create a username and a password in order to use the app. Once a username and password has been created, the user can create, edit, and delete entrie to Tabby. There is no database connected to the application. 

This application is my first successful try at creating a log in feature. I wanted to make an application that required someone to create a username and a password in order to access the site. Although this app doesn't store any data via cookies, local storage, or a database, I still like using it personally just to jot my thoughts down. I kind of wanted to make a diary entry version of snapchat. Only you can see what you've posted and it disappears after you close your window.
